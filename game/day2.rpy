    "I take a deep breath, and open my front door."
    "What greets me is three young men, sharply dressed."
    "All three wear an armband identifying them as low ranking members of the Yosano Group."

    "Ichigaya."
    "Back in the days before the catastrophe, this was a commercial center for Old Tokyo. That, and where the defenders of the old world convened. Or traded death, depending on how jaded you are."
    "These days, it's colored more by small workshops and houses of the city's artisans, creating whatever trinkets the city's elites may want."
    "The car stops just before Akebonobashi, where it crosses the Yasukuni-Dorei, now a canal towards the Kanda River."
    "The Kanda River went up all the way to the hill where the Shinjuku City Council of Guilds and Neighborhood Associations complex now stands."
    "The beating heart of the city's government, one may say."
    "Well, that, and the Yosano Group's compound. Guess which one is more important these days?"
    "To be sure, the Yosanos still have quite the influence and thus vested interest in the Shinjuku municipal government."
    "One can even say the city government and the Yosanos are joined at the hips these days."
    "But considering the breakdown in public order and the incessant gang wars, it's not wrong per se to say that the city government is filled with Yosano goons, or at least not trusted."
    "I'm not one for politics, but I don't even remember anyone from my ward even giving lip service to the government anymore."

    "One boot for another, I guess. Not much difference between those wearing a badge and those with a Kei armband."
    "Entering the compound was a slight uphill trudge, all under the watchful eyes of the city constables, daring you to make a move."
    "As I am about to take up the steps into the City Council building, the henchmen that have been silent for the entire journey stopped me, holding my arms."
    yh1 "Master fortune-teller, as per standard procedure, from this point on, I must respectfully request you be blindfolded."
    yh1 "Madame Yosano has many enemies, unfortunately, and this is simply a precautionary measure. On her behalf, I must apologize."
    yh1 "Ah, no phones either, I'm afraid."

    "I simply nodded and handed over my phone, allowing myself to be blindfolded. He then proceeded to frisk me."
    "After that, I can feel my body being gently prodded from behind, pointing where I should walk."
    "Not long after, I can feel the upward motions of an elevator."
    "And then it stops. The man gently prodded me forward out of the elevator and allowed me to release my blindfold."
    "What greeted my eyes was no other than the personal office of Hibana Yosano, one of the two heads of the Yosano Group."

    yh "Ah, the fortune-teller, come, sit. I have been expecting you."
    "And speak of the devil herself."
    "Hibana Yosano has a fearsome reputation. The Shinjuku Council of Guilds and Neighborhood Associations was very recently an independent organization, a fourth sphere in the city."
    "Within 2 years, that organization has been subsumed completely under the Yosano Group."
    "Either this is something really important or this is some kind of test."
    "And I don't know which is worse."
    yh "Thank you for bringing the young master over, young man. Now, could you be a dear and bring some tea for him too?"

    yh1 "Of course, madam." #[A/N Closing door sound]

    "Cunning as a fox, word on the streets say."
    "She doesn't look any different from any shopkeeper granny, no."
    "But you don't hold the Council in just a couple of years without having a few tricks up your sleeve."

    yh "Now, in regards to why I summoned you, next week, the city hall is organizing Obon."
    yh "My husband would like to contribute handsomely to the endeavor."
    yh "I was wondering if this particular course of action is an auspicious one."

    "...That's it?"
    "This isn't even in my line of work, this should be Reimi's stuff!"

    ry "Of course. That should be rather simple."

    "I begin the standard fortune telling procedure."

    ry "Now, if you could please put your hands around this necklace."

    yh "Well, it does seem that things are fine as is."
    yh "You can pick up your payment when you leave the building, I believe the hourly rate is still the same?"
    ry "Ah, actually I'd rather not charge you the full amount, we've barely gone past 30 minutes."
    ry "Wouldn't feel right."
    yh "Ah. Then why not do small talks?"
    ry "It's okay, I'll take-"
    yh "I insist, young man."
    ry "...Fine. Do note this means I'll charge by the hour."
    yh "Naturally."
    yh "Now, how has life been treating you so far?"
    ry "So-so I guess. Can't complain."
    yh "I'd imagine being the go-to fortune teller for the city's underworld would pay well."
    yh "Have you considered moving out of the undercity? After all, it is within your means."
    ry "I like the neighborhood. Can't see myself moving up like that, honestly."
    yh "Ah, yes, good neighbors. Can't really buy those I suppose."
    yh "Speaking of neighbors."
    "Here we go. What has she got up her sleeve now?"
    yh "Is it not unfortunate that one must have such unruly neighbors?"
    yh "The collapse of the constabulary last year was bad enough, but now this frightful wave of violence."
    yh "Open street fighting in Kabuki-Cho, gunning down of yakuza members in broad daylight in view of the publicâ€¦"
    ry "I don't think it's my place to comment on such matters."
    yh "Surely someone in the middle of all this cannot afford to have no opinion?"
    ry "I'll try my best, madame."
    yh "Even if he were to, hypothetically, be called by one of the main actors of this play, who isn't quite sure if she'll make it through with her head on her shoulder?"
    ry "..."

    "How'd she know?!"
    "Calm down, Ryouhei. Deep internal breathes. More bark than bite."

    ry "*Especially* if that were the case, madame."
    yh "A man of integrity. Not a common sight."

    "She proceeded to pull something out of the obi of her red floral kimono."
    "...A gun?"
    "Pointed at my head?!"

    yh "This is hypothetical, of course, but would that same integrity stay with a sword pointed at your neck?"

    "A hypothetical sword yes, but a very real gun!"

    yh "Now, what did that disgrace ask? And how did you answer her?"
    ry "I-I can't possibl-"

    "She proceeded to put her finger on the trigger, and smiled."

    yh "Don't make this hard on either of us, master fortune-teller, getting blood out of velvet is such an inconvenience."
    ry "Y-you're asking me to breach the confidence clients enjoy, and I can-"
    "*Bang*"

    "Hibana Yosano let out an amused hum. And I am still alive."
    "It was now obvious that the shot was a blank, but I damn near shat myself right then and there."

    yh "Now this is a rarity."
    yh "Perhaps the faith the Old Cabal placed upon you was not misplaced at all."
